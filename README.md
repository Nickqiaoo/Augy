## ‚ú® What is Augy?

Augy is an intelligent desktop application that revolutionizes GUI interaction by allowing you to control your Mac using natural language commands. Built on Anthropic's Claude AI model with advanced computer vision capabilities, Augy can understand what you want to accomplish and execute tasks safely within a secure virtual machine environment.

> **Note**: Augy is based on a modified version of agent-tars developed by ByteDance.

## üöÄ Key Features

### üß† **AI-Powered Control**
- **Natural Language Commands**: Simply describe what you want to do in plain English
- **Advanced Computer Vision**: Analyzes application interfaces and UI elements intelligently
- **Context-Aware Execution**: Understands complex workflows and multi-step processes

### üîí **Built-in Virtual Machine**
- **Secure Isolation**: All operations run in a safe virtual environment powered by Lume
- **Risk-Free Testing**: Experiment without affecting your main system
- **Privacy Protection**: All processing happens locally on your machine

### üéØ **Smart Automation**
- **Cross-Application Workflows**: Seamlessly work across different macOS applications
- **Task Planning**: Breaks down complex requests into manageable steps
- **Error Recovery**: Intelligently handles unexpected situations and retries

### ‚ö° **Developer-Friendly**
- **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Support**: Extensible through custom tools and integrations
- **Local Processing**: No data leaves your machine
- **Apple Silicon Optimized**: Built specifically for modern Macs

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Principles

### Core Components

1. **AI Agent Engine**
   - Powered by Anthropic's Claude with computer use capabilities
   - Advanced prompt engineering for GUI interaction
   - Real-time screen analysis and decision making

2. **Virtual Machine Manager (Lume Integration)**
   - Secure VM provisioning and management
   - Isolated execution environment
   - Resource optimization for smooth performance

3. **Computer Interface Layer**
   - Cross-platform computer control abstraction
   - Mouse, keyboard, and screen interaction
   - Application-specific optimizations

4. **Security & Privacy Framework**
   - Local-first architecture
   - Encrypted communication channels
   - Granular permission controls

### How It Works

1. **Input Processing**: User describes a task in natural language
2. **AI Analysis**: Claude analyzes the request and current screen state
3. **Task Planning**: Breaks down complex tasks into actionable steps
4. **VM Execution**: Executes actions safely within the virtual machine
5. **Feedback Loop**: Provides real-time updates and results



## üìñ Getting Started

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: macOS (Apple Silicon required)
